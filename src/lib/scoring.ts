// Padel tournament scoring logic.
//
// Team points (per match):
//   - Winner gets 3 points; loser gets 0.
//   - Bonus: if the winner wins 6–0, winner gets 4 instead of 3 (loser still 0).
//   - If the match went to tiebreak: winner gets 2, loser gets 1.
//
// Player points (per match):
//   - Each player on a team gets (team_games_for − team_games_against).
//   - Total = sum across all the player's matches / Number of games played.
